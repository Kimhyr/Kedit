# Definitions

Bit			- The most basic unit of text (a symbol).
Byte		- A collection of bits to form a symbol (for UTF encoding).

Write 		- Insert a symbol into a segment.
Erase 		- Delete a symbol in a segment by inserting NUL.

Shift		- Move the segment's content once to the left without moving anything
			  into the prior segment.
Split		- Create a new segment forwards, and move all data from the given index
			  to the new segment.

Climb		- Move to the given segment.
		  	  If a segment is not given, move to the next segment.
Jump		- Move to next segment with mass.
Drop		- Move to the prior segment with mass.

Hanging		- At the end of a segment.
Sleeping	- At the start of a segment.

## Writing

If the cursor is hanging, and the current segment is full: if the next segment
is not empty, create a new segment after the current segment. Climb to the next
segment. If the segment is not full, nothing should be done.

If the cursor is holding, and there exists a empty prior segment, drop to the
prior segment; otherwise, create a segment before the current segment, then
drop to that new prior segment.

If the cursor is climbing, split the segment.

## Erasing

If the cursor is hanging, (even if the segment is full) nothing should be done.

If the cursor is holding, and there exist a prior node, shift the segment, and
fall; if there does not exist a prior node, throw an error.

If the cursor is climbing, split the segment. 

## Keybindings

* Keybinds should be modal.
* Keybinds aren't based off their operation (e.g. `b` for "back");
  keybinds are based off how good the location is.
* CAPS is the mode switcher.
	- insert and
	- normal mode.
* Keymaps:
	- BitMovement:
		* J - Move down
		* K - Move up
		* L - Move right
		* ; - Move left
	- ByteMovement (move per token/line):
		* CTRL + [BitMovement]
	- SelectMovement ():
		* SHIFT + [BitMovement|BlockMovement]
