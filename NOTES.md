## Keybindings

* Keybinds should be modal.
* Keybinds aren't based off their operation (e.g. `b` for "back");
  keybinds are based off how good the location is.
* `CAPS` is the mode switcher.
	- insert and
	- normal mode.
* Keymaps:
	- `BitMovement`:
		* `J` Move down
		* `K` Move up
		* `L` Move right
		* `;` Move left
	- `ByteMovement` (move per token/line):
		* `CTRL + BitMovement`
	- `SelectMovement` ():
		* `SHIFT + [BitMovement|BlockMovement]`
