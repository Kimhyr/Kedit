# Kedit

Kedit is a text editor framework written from complete scratch (that is, without a C++ standard library).

## Building

**WARNING**: This project *probably* only works on Linux for right now.

First, you must have these installed:
	* a C++ compiler that is capable of all C++20 language features (f.e. `clang++`, and `g++`), and
	* GNU Make.

Run `make`.
